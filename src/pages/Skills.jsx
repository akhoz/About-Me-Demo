                    through pointer usage. Additionally, it was in these languages that I learned to implement data structures
                    such as linked lists, queues, stacks, binary trees, and graphs. I hold a keen interest in expanding my

                    projects were academic, they included interesting elements such as socket usage and graphical user interfaces,

                    I gained a wealth of knowledge in low-level programming, covering memory registers, processor instructions, and other
                    fundamental concepts. Despite its initial difficulty, over time, I developed an affinity for this language, and now, I greatly
